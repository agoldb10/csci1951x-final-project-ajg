  Attempt to match the transformed linear combination and target by
    normalizing both and apply the normalized linear combination to the target.
    This method tries different normalization modes to ensure that the
    equalities will match if they are equivalent.
  Although the raw mode may potentially work in all cases, the additional
    modes help create a clearer error message, and some modes are successful in
    certain circumstances while others are not

  Input:
    hsum_on_left : expr, which should be an equality whose right side is 0
